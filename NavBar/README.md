# Structure of Navigation bar

## blue part and red part are controlled by different sections!

I personally called the blue part main menu, and the red part sub menu.

#### Let's start from the red part (sub menu,  inside the navigation bar)

- access from the Elementors -> Appearance -> Menu

- hover on the one you want to edit, then click the blue button (Mega Menu)

- then clik the edit content in the popout window

- here are some setting, I added the css, which control the font size when user hover over. 

- If we want to add things into the submenu, use the tab on the left (first one for the elements inside, second and third for the styles!)

#### Here is for the main menu!

- You can access it from editing any pages, just hover on it ( the nav bar section) and click the "edit post" botton. Elementores will automatically transfer you into the main menu setting.

But the content inside the whole nav bar can't be edit here. We need to go  Appearance -> Menu again!

Note of our nav bar setting now.
