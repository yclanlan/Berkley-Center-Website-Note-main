# Hi there! 
This document aims to help you understand what I did for the Berkley Center website in WordPress!

#### There are five sections included in this documentation.
- Structure of the website
- some settings I changed for the nav bar

- About the Entrepreneurs Challenge
- the past winner of the "Entrepreneurs Challenge"

- SVF- Stern Venture Fellows
- Resources page under development




_____

## 1. Structure of the website

(Before starting, in my understanding, there are two ways to add content in WordPress: posts and pages. I used pages most of the time!)

Now, WordPress pages are placed in folders based on the content structured in the navigation bar. 

Be sure to duplicate a page every time you create a new one. ( And clean up the old pages sometimes!)

Drag it can change it to a different folder.

## 2. About Navigation Bar!
Go to the NavBar folder or this <a src="https://yclanlan.github.io/Berkley-Center-Website-Note-main/NavBar/">[link](https://yclanlan.github.io/Berkley-Center-Website-Note-main/NavBar/)</a>

## 3. About the Entrepreneurs Challenge

- I want to highlight the complex parts "Entrepreneurs Challenge", 
I organize them into three different sections"
- #### 1. The main page
- #### 2. The pages
- #### 3. List and team pages 

( Note: Entrepreneurs Challenge has three stages: venture showcase -> semi-final -> final, so different lists are in the folder )

So, in this picture, the structure in the nav bar is at the top left. The part under it is what you will see in the WordPress editor. On the right side, it is a preview!

## 4. Past Winners of Entrepreneurs Challenge!
Go to the pastwinner folder or this <a src="https://yclanlan.github.io/Berkley-Center-Website-Note-main/pastwinner/">[link](https://yclanlan.github.io/Berkley-Center-Website-Note-main/pastwinner/)</a>

I put the content into separate pages (in the GitHub!) 
so we can put them into the tabs in the Elementers component.

## 6. Resources page

Haven't added it to the website!
In the process of how to make the content organized and available.
(Now we want to present it in different stages you are when you want to be an Entrepreneur )
